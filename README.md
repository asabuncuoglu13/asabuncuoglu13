### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m currently working at Accenture's Global Responsible AI practice. Prior, I was a researcher at the Alan Turing Institute in [Finance and Economics Programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/finance-and-economics) and a scientific advisor at the Innovate UK's Bridge AI programme. Previously, I conducted my PhD studies at [KUIS AI Lab](https://ai.ku.edu.tr/) - [Intelligent Interfaces Group](https://iui.ku.edu.tr/).
